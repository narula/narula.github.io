# Gold vaults

A year ago I toured [the gold vault beneath the New York
Fed](https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/goldvault.html). You might
recall it from the classic 1995 movie [Die Hard with a Vengeance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112864/), but
in case you aren’t familiar: It’s the world’s largest depository of
monetary gold, storing over 6,000 tons 80 feet below Manhattan and
protected by airtight vaults and its own police force.

The first thing I thought when I was down there was wow, gold is very
shiny. The second was wow, gold bars are surprisingly heavy, in part
because of its density (bars are 28 pounds). They make you wear metal
shoe covers to hold one in case you drop it on your foot. But the
third thing I thought is “THIS is what the global monetary system
rests on? This is just so _antiquated_.”

The New York Fed gold vault has some surprising similarities to Bitcoin:

* **Pseudonymity**: Each country’s holdings of gold are held in separate compartments that are identified by numbers, not names.
* **Multisig**: Each compartment is secured by a padlock, two combination locks and an auditor’s seal, each under the control of someone different so multiple people have to come together to open the compartment.
* **Transaction fee model**: Storage is free, but you pay to move gold bars in and out or between compartments. So HODLers free ride, which honestly makes me worry about its long-term sustainability.
* **Vaults**: It has multi-layered vault technology with timelocks! There is a 90 ton steel cylinder door, and once closed, it locks the vault till the next business day. And it’s an airtight and watertight seal.

But there’s a really important difference between the gold vault and
Bitcoin. The gold vault is only available to governments, central
banks, and official international institutions. Bitcoin is for
anyone. We’re not just trying to digitize the gold vault. We’re trying
to build something _better_.

Sometimes, though, we get distracted along the way. We get distracted
by CEOs of $10 trillion+ asset managers name-dropping “Bitcoin” on
CNBC or billionaires taking on debt to hoard coins or nation-state
strategic reserves, we mistake all that for progress. But it’s
not. Those things are second-order effects of progress. First-order
progress is, and always was, USERS. Providing real value to real
people. All the financialization, all the follow-on by institutions,
it’s a side-effect, it’s not the real goal. Too often we forget that
and chase the mirage.

# Reflecting on MIT

Universities and academia are in a bit of a strange place right now. I
am not really sure they’ll all survive (nor that they all should). But MIT is unique and
well-positioned to weather the uncertainty facing higher
education. The motto of MIT is “mens et manus”, or mind and hand. It
signifies the fusion of the pursuit of academic knowledge with
practical purpose. I feel grateful to have been trained here in
graduate school, and I am so grateful for all the wonderful students,
researchers, and staff I've gotten to work with at the [Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu). We all
chose to be part of this quirky, earnest group trying to make a better
financial system for everyone. Because of how special it is, I think
MIT is in a unique place to contribute to this field, even more so
than other schools.

Our field could use a little more mens et manus. Yes, the theory and
protocol design are incredibly important. There is still so much to
figure out and do. But the users are the real point. We have to solve
real problems for real users.

If what we have in 50 years is the New York Fed Bitcoin vault, but
users can’t easily and safely self-custody—we failed.  If we build
only for traders and whales and ignore those who need privacy,
autonomy, and access—we failed. Also, quite frankly, it’s
uninteresting: We’d just be replicating the existing structure of the
financial system we’re trying to fix.

I don’t know if whatever we're seeking is possible to achieve at
scale, but I don’t know that it’s impossible either, and I’m not
willing to give up yet.

The DCI has been steadily supporting senior Bitcoin developers for 10
years. The people who worked here have been quietly, but measurably,
improving the Bitcoin network’s stability, scalability, and
security. I hope the DCI is still at MIT in another 10 years—doing
work that improves strong self-custody, privacy, and security, but
also helps improve access to Bitcoin and other digital currencies as
part of an open, permissionless financial system, a platform on which
application developers can build services and applications that give
users the tools they need to financially flourish.

If this mission resonates with you, [reach out](narula@mit.edu). We’re always looking
for collaborators. And if you have the means, consider [supporting our
work](https://www.dci.mit.edu/support-our-work)—we raise all our own funding.
